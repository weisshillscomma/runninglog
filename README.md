# runninglog

A simple layout that pulls data from an Airtable database.

Make a copy of https://airtable.com/universe/expLJI3KyA8vyl3Sf/nyc-marathon-2021-training-plan as the base for this site.

Update your Airtable API and base in the code. You'll also need to get Parsedown (https://parsedown.org/) to handle parsing the formatting markdown output by Airtable.
